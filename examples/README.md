# Example data
This folder contains datasets exported from two different battery cyclers which can be used to demonstrate the full functionality of GalvAnalyze.

## Case 1
File Case1_ActiveMass_18mg_CurrentThreshold_0.15mA.txt

Description
Cell cycled for XX cycles in total, beginning with a charge (First cycle is charge default setting)

The active mass for this cell was 18 mg.

A variable current was applied (0.17 mA for NN cycles and 1.7 mA for MM cycles). Analysis of this dataset requires use of the Applied current varies option.
Given the minimum current of X we recomend a threshold of 0.15 mA).

## Case 2
File Case2_ActiveMass_1000mg_CurrentThreshold_0.25mA.txt

Description
Cell cycled for XX cycles and beginning with a discharge (First cycle is charge needs to be un-ticked)

The active mass for this cell was 1000 mg.

A constant current was applied (0.283 mA for 6 cycles). Analysis of this dataset requires use of the Applied current varies option.
