TO-DO:

1 - Hysteresis plot functionality
	* Option to chose an exported C1D1 file and create a hysteresis plot of selected charge-discharge file
	* RORY find an example to work towards
	* Include plot of C1D1 hysteresis when "save individual charge and ..." is selected

2 - Create error common messages

3 - Create read-me
	* Explain basic functionality and use to layman audience
	* Explain error messages

4 - Asthetics
	* Plot legends (Capacity graph below? Charge discharge curves at the RHS?)
	* Find potential limits to stop drift (Indexing error - need to -1) and set limit = 0 mAh g-1
	* Think about pop-out label names
	* Put individual cycles into folder called "Charge-Discharge pairs"
	* Remove italics from axis titles
	* "mAh g^-1"
	* Set Capacity axis minimum to 0 always
