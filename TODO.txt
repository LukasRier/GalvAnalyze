TO-DO:

1 - Hysteresis plot functionality
	* Option to chose an exported C1D1 file and create a hysteresis plot of selected charge-discharge file
	* Include plot of C1D1 hysteresis when "save individual charge and ..." is selected
	* Examples of hysteresis plots in GitHub folder

2 - Can we increase the path length for files? Some people have an error that the file path length is too long and have to do their
    data analysis from a USB stick to make things easier

3 - Create error common messages

4 - Create read-me
	* Explain basic functionality and use to layman audience
	* Explain error messages

5 - Asthetics
	* Put individual cycles into folder called "Charge-Discharge pairs"
	* Colour gradient of charges and colour gradient of discharges for ease of analysis
