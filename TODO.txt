TO-DO:

1 - Hysteresis plot functionality
	* Option to chose an exported C1D1 file and create a hysteresis plot of selected charge-discharge file
	* RORY find an example to work towards
	* Include plot of C1D1 hysteresis when "save individual charge and ..." is selected

2 - Can we increase the path length for files? Some people have an error that the file path length is too long and have to do their
    data analysis from a USB stick to make things easier

3 - Create error common messages

4 - Create read-me
	* Explain basic functionality and use to layman audience
	* Explain error messages

5 - Asthetics
	* Plot legends (Capacity graph below? Charge discharge curves at the RHS? Or wider graph C1 , D1 rather than Charge 1 etc - below?)
	* Find potential limits to stop drift (Indexing error - need to -1) and set limit = 0 mAh g-1
	* Think about pop-out label names
	* Put individual cycles into folder called "Charge-Discharge pairs"
	* Remove italics from axis titles
	* "mAh g^-1"
	* Set Capacity axis minimum to 0 always
	* Colour gradient of charges and colour gradient of discharges for ease of analysis
