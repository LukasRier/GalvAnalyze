* Remove the final cycle data from the longest cycle (if cycles not equal)

* Create ability to input data from second software ('time /s', 'I /mA', 'E /V')
  Capacity calculated through time*current/3600 = mAh g-1

* Coulombic efficiency plot (ratio of charge to discharge capacity)
  + add to csv of charge discharge

* make executable

* make interface?
	* include cleverer thresholding
		* manual or adaptive if currents change
