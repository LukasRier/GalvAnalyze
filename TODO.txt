TO-DO:

1 - Hysteresis plot functionality
	* Option to chose an exported C1D1 file and create a hysteresis plot of selected charge-discharge file
	* Include plot of C1D1 hysteresis when "save individual charge and ..." is selected
	* Add gui tab containing "Load file" button, "No file selected" box and "Create Hysteresis plot" button
	* Takes input of the C1D1 files and spits out a hysteresis graph and .csv file to match

2 - Can we increase the path length for files? Some people have an error that the file path length is too long and have to do their
    data analysis from a USB stick to make things easier
	* Lukas working on solution

3 - Asthetics
	* Colour gradient of charges and colour gradient of discharges for ease of analysis
	* Make hysteresis graphs look nice (Change axis titles, add legend, colour scheme - blue solid, blue dashed)

4 - Create error common messages
	* Find common errors
	* Find datasets that don't work

5 - Create read-me - final touches
	* Explain basic functionality and use to layman audience
	* Explain error messages
